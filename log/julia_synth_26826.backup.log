WARNING: [DRC DPBU-1] Clock leaf drivers: Invalid connection used for DSP48E1. Unroutable DSP connection found on raddr. Pin raddr/CEC is driven by BUFG/BUFH/BUFR clk_pixel_BUFG_inst. This can lead to an unroutable situation.

WARNING: [DRC DPOP-1] PREG Output pipelining: DSP mp/alu1/ARG output mp/alu1/ARG/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.

WARNING: [DRC DPOP-2] MREG Output pipelining: DSP mp/alu1/ARG multiplier stage mp/alu1/ARG/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
